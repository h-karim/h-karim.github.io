										<h1>Google Summer of Code 2020</h1>
										<h2>Project Title: Visualization</h2>
										<h2>Student </h2>
										<p>Karim Hasbini</p>
										<h2>Mentors</h2>
										<p>Christine Rogers<br/>
										CÃ©cile Madjar
										</p>
										<h2>Teammate</h2>
										<p>Laetitia Fesselier</p>
										
										<h2>Organization</h2>
										<p>INCF</p>
										<h2>Overview</h2>	
										<p>
												The goal of this project is to provide BIDS-iEEG compatibility for LORIS as 
												well as visualization for EEG and iEEG recordings for the electrophysiology 
												module by using an already existing React library. 
										</p>
										<h2>Deliverables</h2>
										<ul>
												<li>Install LORIS and understand codebase</li>
												<li>Work on issues from different modules and issue pull requests</li>
												<li>Add iEEG support to LORIS-MRI</li>
												<li>Connect visualization library to LORIS</li>
										</ul>
										<h2>Timeline</h2>
										<h3>May: First Contact</h3>
										<p>I was introduced to the team behind LORIS in may as well as install it on 
										a virtual machine hosted at the 
										<a href="https://mcin.ca/">McGill Center for Integrative Neuroscience </a> in order to familiarize
										myself with the codebase. Due to the pandemic at the time, I could not meet the team in person. Nevertheless, 
										attending several meetings allowed me to take on issues from the backlog.</p>
										<h3>June</h3>
										<p>In June I worked on several issues spanning different LORIS modules (with a focus on the electrophysiology browser)
										in order to further develop my understanding of the software stack used. LORIS was going through a release testing phase
										which I participated in by providing feedback on the results of the testing plans. I was 
										also fortunate enough to attend the <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3958">OHBM</a>
										virtual brainhack conference where I got to listen to a talk about <a href="https://bids.neuroimaging.io/">BIDS</a>.
										</p>
										<h3>July</h3>
										<p>July was marked by switching my attention to <a href="https://github.com/aces/Loris-MRI/">LORIS-MRI</a>, a sister
										repo to LORIS used to upload EEG files in BIDS format to its database. I focused on reading the code as well 
										as documentation on EEG and iEEG-BIDS. This allowed me to implement changes required to adapt the upload pipeline to
										support iEEG-BIDS directories. By the end of July iEEg data was successfully uploaded and a pull request was opened.
										</p>
										<h3>August</h3>
