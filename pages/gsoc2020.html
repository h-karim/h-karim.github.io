										<h2>Overview</h2>	
										<p>
												The goal of this project is to provide BIDS-iEEG compatibility for LORIS as 
												well as visualization for EEG and iEEG recordings for the electrophysiology 
												module by using an already existing React library. 
										</p>
										<h2>Deliverables</h2>
										<ul>
												<li>Install LORIS and understand code base</li>
												<li>Work on issues from different modules and issue pull requests</li>
												<li>Add iEEG support to LORIS-MRI</li>
												<li>Connect visualization library to LORIS</li>
										</ul>
										<h2>Timeline</h2>
										<h3>May: First Contact</h3>
										<p>I was introduced to the team behind LORIS in may as well as install it on 
										a virtual machine hosted at the 
										<a href="https://mcin.ca/">McGill Center for Integrative Neuroscience </a> in order to familiarize
										myself with the code base. Due to the pandemic at the time, I could not meet the team in person. Nevertheless, 
										attending several meetings allowed me to take on issues from the backlog.</p>
										<h3>June</h3>
										<p>In June I worked on several issues spanning different LORIS modules (with a focus on the electrophysiology browser)
										in order to further develop my understanding of the software stack used. LORIS was going through a release testing phase
										which I participated in by providing feedback on the results of the testing plans. I was 
										also fortunate enough to attend the <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3958">OHBM</a>
										virtual brainhack conference where I got to listen to a talk about <a href="https://bids.neuroimaging.io/">BIDS</a>.
										</p>
										<h3>July</h3>
										<p>July was marked by switching my attention to <a href="https://github.com/aces/Loris-MRI/">LORIS-MRI</a>, a sister
										repo to LORIS used to upload EEG and MRI files in BIDS format to its database. I focused on reading the code as well 
										as documentation on EEG and iEEG-BIDS. This allowed me to implement changes required to adapt the upload pipeline to
										support iEEG-BIDS directories. By the end of July iEEG data was successfully uploaded and a pull request was opened.
										</p>
										<h3>August</h3>
										<p>In August, my pull request was reviewed and merged, adding initial support for iEEG-BIDS to LORIS-MRI.
										A plan was drafted offering two strategies to add support to electrical stimulation files.
										The rest of my focus was on connecting an already written visualization library dating back to 2018 to LORIS in 
										order to visualize EEG and iEEG signals. Thanks to Laetitia, we were able to install the library on a recent 
										version of LORIS, however many errors were still present which prevented visualization. Some of the errors were
										resolved while some remain present. To continue progress, code using the react-three library should be refactored
										to instead take advantage of react-three-fiber. </p>

										Presentation</a></h2>
										<p>On Tuesday 4<sup>th</sup> of August I gave a brief presentation about my progress to the rest of the LORIS 
										team, including some of the libraries and approaches used to solve the problems that I faced and the challenge
										left to solve for August.</p>
										<h2>Conclusion</h2> 
										<p>Despite the conditions of pandemic, I was able to learn a lot. Being exposed to experienced developers 
										and working alongside them to merge code allowed me to find areas needing work in my coding and documentation
										skills, all while contributing to an open source project under a learning environment. I would like to wish 
										everyone at the LORIS team continued success in their endeavour towards a more open world of scientific research.</p>
